# TX1 setup script for use as companion computer

# STEP1 : install NVidia image onto TX1 (skip this step if you already have a factory image (created in Step2) for the current release of JetPack
#
# Connect TX1 via USB to Ubuntu machine and put TX1 into bootloader mode:
#    Hold Force Recovery button (aka "REC"), press Reset button(aka "RST"), Release Force Recovery button
#    On Ubuntu machine "lsusb", and look for "NVidia Corp"
#
# Install JetPack on an Ubuntu 14.04 machine, while connected to the internet:
# mkdir JetPack-2.3.1
# download https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/dlc/jetpack-l4t-2_3_1 (nvidia login required)
# from the directory you want JetPack installed into (i.e. JetPack-2.3.1) run "sh ./JetPack-L4T-2.3.1-linux-x64.run"
#    select Jetson TX1 Development Kit and Ubuntu Host
#    On JetPack L4T Component Manager:
#        - Custom
#        * Common: no action
#        * CUDA Toolkit for Ubuntu 14.04: no action
#        * OpenCV for Tegra on Ubuntu 14.04: no action
#        * For Jetson TX1 64bit: mixed
#           * Linux for Tegra (TX1 64bit): install
#              * Driver for OS: install
#              * File System: install
#        * Post Install: mixed
#           * Flash OS: install
#           * CUDA Toolkit for L4T: install
#           * Compile CUDA Samples: no action
#           * PerfKit: install
#           * TensorRT(GIE 1.0 RC): install
#           * Multimedia API package: no action
#           * cuDNN Package: install
#           * OpenCV for Tegra: install
#        * VisionWorks on TX1 Target: no action
#    Click Next, and Accept All
#    "Network Layout" screen should appear:
#       Select "Device accesses Internet via router/switch", Next
#       Select network adapter to use to connect to TX (i.e. eth0 if your Ubuntu machine uses eth0 to access your local internet)
#       when "Post Installation Jetson TX1, Following actions will be performed at this stage.." screen appears click Next
#    Black screen, "Please put your device to Force USB Recovery Mode", press <Enter>
#       Eventually, "Finished Flashing OS, Please press Reset button on device, Press Enter key to continue" will be displayed, press <Enter>
#
# STEP1B: if you want to re-use a factory image (e.g. one downloaded in STEP2):
#   (possibly bring up Vagrant virtual machine)

# STEP2 : Download base image from TX1 (e.g. if you want to take a copy of the factory image)
#    put TX1 into bootloader mode: Hold Force Recovery button (aka "REC"), press Reset button(aka "RST"), Release Force Recovery button
#    cd to directory where JetPack was installed (i.e. JetPack-2.3.1)

# Step 3 : install packages on TX1
#    power on the TX1
#    log onto TX1 as ubuntu/ubuntu (you may be able to do this over ethernet using the tegra-ubuntu hostname)
#    create an apsync user:

#    ssh in as apsync, or switch-user to apsync
#    open terminal
