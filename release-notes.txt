Release NEXT
 - Runs on Pi0W, however the shortage of memory makes it a poor development platform
 - APWeb (https://github.com/ardupilot/APWeb/) runs on port 80
 - RPI image created from 2017-07-05-raspbian-jessie-lite.zip
 - still no BeagleBoneBlue release due to performance questions 

Ask people if they would update their bootloader
 - at the risk of needing JTAG to recover their boards
 - but with the possibility of updating their PixHawk over serial
